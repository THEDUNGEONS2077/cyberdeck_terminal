/**
 * src/lib/sharpness.ts: how many canvas pixels a wallpaper draws per CSS
 * px, and the guard that keeps that from costing smoothness.
 *
 * Layer: pure lib (the wallpaper host uses it; tested).
 *
 * Each wallpaper has a safe cap (catalog.ts `safeDpr`: 2, VELOCITY 1.5),
 * what it drew at before 0.14.0. On a screen with more pixels than that
 * (200% scaling and up) it now draws at the screen's own ratio, up to
 * SHARP_DPR, the sharpest picture the screen can show (C4: "full fidelity
 * on your PC"). A guard watches its first seconds on screen: if drawing a
 * frame takes too long (p95 over GUARD_BUDGET_MS, half a 60 Hz frame), it
 * steps back to the safe cap and remembers that, per wallpaper. It never
 * goes below the safe cap: quality is never lowered on the web.
